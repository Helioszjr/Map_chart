<P>MapChart 2.32: November 2017</P>
<P>Since about 2015 MapChart would fail to create a window on some systems. This occurred
   on Windows 7, 8 and 10. Sometimes the problem would appear or disappear after a Windows
   update. With version 2.32 the problem is solved.</P>

<P>MapChart 2.3: January 2015</P>

<UL>
<LI>New installer, works on all with Windows 7 and 8 systems as well as older ones</LI>
<LI>Added more zoom levels and manual adjusting of zoom level</LI>
<LI>Added option to suppress QTL names</LI>
<LI>Rewritten parsing of MapQTL 5.0 and 6.0 output files (the old version did not work
    for all population types)</LI>
<LI>Corrected: occasional incorrect lines connecting homologs</LI>
<LI>Corrected: sometimes &quot;omitted&quot; loci were considered as homologs</LI>
<LI>corrected: chart title could not be removed</LI>
</UL>

<P>MapChart 2.2: April 2006</P>

<UL>
<LI>Reads MapQTL 5.0 output files</LI>
<LI>Graph files can contain data for multiple linkage groups (less clutter of data files)</LI>
<LI>New formatting &quot;Omit&quot; for markers: allows to create skeleton maps showing a few markers with name and only ticks at the positions of all &quot;omitted&quot; markers</LI>
<LI>Exports charts as bitmaps as well as metafiles</LI>
<LI>Data font can be set and is retained between sessions</LI>
<LI>Removed limitation to size of data</LI>
<LI>Improved printing control (color / grayscale, resolution)
<li>Autofit improved</UL>


<P>MapChart 2.11: June 2003</P>
<P>This version corrects a few minor errors in version 2.1 and is otherwise unchanged.</P>

<P>MapChart 2.1: June 2002</P>

<UL>
<LI>Homologous loci can be highlighted and/or connected with lines</LI>
<LI>"Combine Maps" tool: puts the corresponding linkage groups from several files side by side, especially useful for showing homologies between maps</LI>
<LI>Linkage groups that are parts of the same chromosome can be automatically aligned under each other</LI>
<LI>Chart title on the first page or on all pages</LI>
<LI>Footer with page number, file name and/or date</LI>
<LI>Extra option to indicate locus positions: ruler at left side of page, as alternative to locus positions, intervals or ticks along the linkage group bars</LI>
<LI>Up to three text columns next to the locus names can be used, instead of only one</LI>
<LI>Texts can be shown with or without specific formatting of locus name</LI>
<LI>Constant graph lines (e.g. LOD thresholds) can now be specified directly, instead of being read from a file</LI>
<LI>Graphs can be shown with bold lines</LI>
<LI>More QTL interval options: line style, bold lines, with or without cross-dash at ends</LI>
<LI>Normal and bold line width can be specified</LI>
<LI>Indicators connecting highlighted locus names with their positions on the linkage group bar can be highlighted bold and/or in color</LI>
<LI>Vertical shift distance can now be expressed either in mm or in map units</LI>
<LI>Map files containing ";" (the comment character) as part of the locus or linkage group names are now read like in JoinMap and MapQTL</LI>
<LI>Dashed and dotted lines were drawn incorrectly on some printers; corrected</LI>
<LI>Occasionally loci appearing on the left side of the bar were not shown; corrected</LI>
<LI>Several minor bug fixes</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Already available in version 2.0 of 14 May 2001:</I></P>

<UL>
<LI>Map datafiles can be exported for use in <I>e.g.</I> MapQTL</LI>
<LI>Locus names can be suppressed. If also positions are suppressed the
    linkage group bar only shows lines at the locus positions.</LI>
<LI>Graph files can now have multiple data columns.
    A graph option selects which column to use; &quot;LOD&quot; is the default.
	MapQTL 3.0 and 4.0 output can be read without editing.</LI>
</UL>

<P>MapChart 2.0: 20 February 2001</P>

<UL>
<LI>Change to the copyright:<BR>
    The copyright of MapChart now belongs to Plant Research International,
	Wageningen, The Netherlands</LI>

<LI>Changes to interface:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Multiple document interface: multiple maps can be open simultaneously.
    Useful for comparisons and for updating information from one map to
	another (see below)</LI>
<LI>Both the map data and the chart options are now stored in one file
    (*.mct) instead of in separate *.map and *.set files.
	Useful because *.map files with different formats are also used for
	other purposes (e.g. for MapQTL input).</LI>
<LI>MapChart files (*.mct) are registered: double-clicking on a *.mct file
    in the Explorer will cause MapChart to open the file</LI>
<LI>On opening a file, the chart is displayed instead of the data</LI>
<LI>On zooming in or out, the image now remains centered on the same spot.</LI>
<LI>Changed layout of some forms to improve legibility with different
    Windows screen font sizes</LI>
<LI>Right-click (pop-up) menu’s</LI>
<LI>MapChart will start maximized if it was closed in a maximized state
    in the previous session</LI>
<LI>The font of the Data sheet can be specified</LI>
<LI>When errors in the data are found, the cursor is placed on the
    erroneous line</LI>
<LI>When errors in the Chart options dialog are found, the error is
    highlighted</LI>
<LI>The <A HREF="MCManual.htm">manual</A> is now a HTML file with contents,
    index and links</LI>
</UL>

<LI>New functionality:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>All kinds of formatting information (formatting of linkage groups and loci;
    QTLs, graphs, bar segments, chart options, page setup) can be copied from
	one map to another. Useful for transferring this information to a new
	version of the map.</LI>
<LI>&quot;Autofit&quot; added: if the charts don’t fit on the page size
    with the current chart options, MapChart now attempts to fit the charts
	by changing several combinations of chart options.</LI>
<LI>Unlimited numbers of color codes can now be used (a consequence is
    that the color coding is slightly modified, but map files of
	version 1.x are automatically converted)</LI>
<LI>With a transparent background, now a background color is shown on screen,
    so that white lines, texts and symbols are visible.</LI>
<LI>Bars of linkage groups can now be aligned vertically (to show two parts
    belonging to the same chromosome)</LI>
<LI>Positions along the linkage group bars can now be indicated in four ways:
    no positions, absolute positions of loci, intervals between loci, or
	ticks at fixed intervals</LI>
<LI>The font size of individual loci can now be specified</LI>
<LI>The Y-axis of graphs can now be formatted: low and high limits,
    tick interval, number of decimals; if not specified they are
	automatically determined as before</LI>
<LI>Improved drawing of dashed and dotted lines in Graphs</LI>
<LI>The size of symbols in graphs can now be specified</LI>
<LI>Linkage group bars can now be shown with either flat or rounded tips.</LI>
<LI>Bugs in Mirror and Reverse options of linkage groups fixed</LI>
<LI>Several other minor bugs solved. </LI>
