<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="Version"></A><A NAME="_Toc12"></A><B>Version</B></P>
<P>The current version is MapChart 2.32, released November 2017.
   The most recent version can always be found on the website of Wageningen University and Research 
   (at the time of writing:
   <A HREF="https://www.wur.nl/en/show/Mapchart.htm">https://www.wur.nl/en/show/Mapchart.htm</A>).</P>

<P><A NAME="HowToRefer"></A><A NAME="_Toc13"></A><B>How to refer to MapChart</B></P>
<P>A description of MapChart appears in the following publication:<BR/>
   Voorrips, R.E., 2002. MapChart: Software for the graphical presentation of
   linkage maps and QTLs. The Journal of Heredity 93 (1): 77-78.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="WhatisMapChart"></A><A NAME="_Toc14"></A><B>What is MapChart ?</B></P>
<P>MapChart is a computer package that produces charts of genetic linkage and QTL data.
   These charts are composed of a sequence of vertical bars representing the linkage groups or chromosomes.
   On these bars the positions of loci are indicated, and next to the bars QTL intervals and QTL graphs
   can be shown. MapChart reads the linkage information (i.e. the locus and QTL names and their positions)
   from text files. This information has to be calculated beforehand, usually with genetic mapping software
   such as JoinMap<SUP>&reg;</SUP> and MapQTL<SUP>&reg;</SUP>.</P>
<P>The charting needs of geneticists vary widely. Therefore MapChart comes with many options to adapt the
   charts to different purposes. However, no charting package can cater for all situations.
   Charts will often have to be adapted manually. Therefore MapChart is designed to produce graphic files
   which can be imported by and edited with other software.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="Installation"></A><A NAME="_Toc15"></A><B>Installation</B></P>
<P>MapChart will usually be installed through a setup program. This will create a new directory
   &quot;MapChart&quot;, by default under the Program files (x86) directory.
   In this directory MapChart.exe, MCManual.htm (this manual) and several other files
   are placed along with a subdirectory &quot;Examples&quot;.
   The setup program will also create a MapChart entry in the Start menu.</P>
   
<P><A HREF="#Contents">Contents</A> <A HREF="#Index">Index</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="UpgradeIssues"></A><A NAME="_Toc16"></A><B>New features and upgrade issues</B></P>
<P>For an overview of the new features, enhancements and bug fixes since previous versions of MapChart,
   see the <A HREF="MCWhatsNew.htm">MCWhatsNew.htm</A> file in the MapChart program directory.
   MapChart 2.0 was a completely rewritten version with many new features and a new user interface.
   Version 2.1 added the possibility to show <A HREF="#Homologs">homologies</A>
   between loci on different linkage groups, <A HREF="#OptionsTitleFooter">Chart titles</A>,
   the automatic <A HREF="#LinkGrpsChrom">vertical alignment</A> of linkage groups
   to show that they belong to the same chromosome, and
   <A HREF="#OptionsTitleFooter">page footers</A> with page number, date and/or file name.
   The main changes in version 2.2 were the &quot;<A HREF="#OmitLocus">omit</A>&quot; option
   for locus names, the possibility to export bitmaps (*.bmp) as well as metafiles,
   and an extended <A HREF="#GraphFiles">graph file</A> format that allows files
   to contain data for multiple linkage groups and the reading of MapQTL 5.0 output files.</P>
<P>Version 2.3 added more flexible zooming of the charts and had a more robust
   import of MapQTL 5.0 / 6.0 output files (the previous version was limited to only a few
   population types). QTL names can now be suppressed. Also a different installer was used
   as the previous one occasionally gave problems under Windows 7 and 8.</P>
<P>The current version (2.32) addresses an issue where on some systems MapChart could not
   create a window, a problem that sometimes arose or disappeared after a Windows update.</P>   

<P><A NAME="_Toc17"></A><B><I>Upgrading from version 1.x</I></B></P>
<P><A NAME="UpgradeColor"></A>The current version of MapChart will import
   the *.map / *.set file pairs produced by version 1.x.
   All the old formatting is still valid, with the exception of the
   color codes. In version 1.x, the default color code was C0, and only
   codes C0 - C9 were available. The background color was specified
   separately and did not correspond to a color code.
   In contrast, the current version can handle up to 1000 color codes,
   code C0 specifies the background color and C1 the default color.
   When importing version 1.x files, MapChart automatically assigns the
   old background color to C0, and C0 - C9 to the new codes C1 - C10.
   In this way the charts are produced with the same colors as before.
   However, when editing these charts the new color codes must be used.
   Further, in version 1.x color codes could be specified with only the
   number; in the current version the number must be preceded with a
   &quot;c&quot; or &quot;C&quot;.</P>
<P><A NAME="UpgradeDefDir"></A>In version 1.x, the command-line
   parameter /d=&lt;default directory&gt; could be specified
   with or without the &quot;/&quot; in front. The current version
   requires the &quot;/&quot;, because the first parameter without
   &quot;/&quot; is interpreted as a file to be opened.
   It may therefore be necessary to change any shortcuts referring to MapChart.</P>

<P><A NAME="_Toc18"></A><B><I>Upgrading from version 2.0</I></B></P>
<P>Files of version 2.0 are generally displayed unchanged in version 2.3, with two exceptions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The indicators of highlighted loci (indicators are the lines connecting
    locus names to their position on the linkage group bar):
	these indicators are now shown bold and in the color of the locus name.
	This can be changed by clearing the
	"<A HREF="#IndicatorsHighlight">Highlighting indicators</A>" checkboxes
	on the Chart options - Bars page.</LI>
<LI>The locus texts (the texts that can be shown in separate columns next to
    the locus names) are now shown without the formatting  (style, color, size)
	of individual locus names. In order to apply this formatting also to the
	locus texts check &quot;<A HREF="#TextLocusStyle">Text in locus style</A>
	&quot; on the Chart options – Loci page.</LI>
</UL>

<P>In some cases small changes in the data are needed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If graphs with the name "const" are present, these should be renamed
    as "const" is now a keyword</LI>
<LI>Comment characters (";") should be preceded by a space if they don't
    occur at the start of a line to make sure
	they are recognized as the start of a comment,
	to conform to the JoinMap / MapQTL standard.</LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="_Toc19"></A><B><I>Upgrading from version 2.1</I></B></P>
<UL>
<LI>If <A HREF="#GraphFiles">Graph files</A> contained columns with caption
    &quot;position&quot; or &quot;group&quot; these must be changed,
	as these words are recognized keywords in version 2.2.</LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="_Toc19a"></A><B><I>Upgrading from version 2.2</I></B></P>
<P>No changes are needed, all existing projects will still produce identical results.</P>

<P>In general, files produced by newer versions may be read incorrectly or not at all by older versions. </P>

<P><A NAME="Drawingcharts"></A><A NAME="_Toc20"></A><B>Drawing charts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="DataChartSheet"></A>A map window in MapChart has two pages, 
   which can be selected by clicking their tabs: the Data page, 
   which shows an editor where the names, positions and formatting of the map elements are entered, 
   and the Chart page where the charts are displayed. </P>
<P>The drawing of a chart starts with a linkage map, such as produced by JoinMap, 
   with a sequence of linkage groups each with the loci listed in ascending order 
   of position (<A HREF="#Examples">Example 1</A>). To each linkage group QTL bars and graphs can be added, 
   and segments of the linkage groups can be highlighted. All this information is entered 
   in the Data page (see <A HREF="#DataFormat">Data Format</A>), which is displayed when you choose 
   File – New from the Main menu. Map files can also be imported, by choosing File – Open 
   and selecting file type &quot;Map file&quot; (or &quot;All files&quot;, if your map file has 
   an extension other than ".map"); in that case the Chart page with the calculated chart is shown.</P>
<P><A HREF="#ChartOptions">Chart Options</A> (Tools menu) is used to specify the general appearance 
   of the charts, such as the fonts used for the different elements, the various colors, the size 
   and layout of the pages etc. Finally, for individual elements exceptions to these general 
   chart option can be specified in the Data page, such as a different font size for specific loci, 
   and extra formatting such as fill style, color codes can be added 
   (see <A HREF="#DataFormat">Data Format</A>).</P>
<P>The chart pages are displayed by choosing the Chart tab, or by opening a map or MapChart data file. 
   If no charts can be calculated because of errors in the data, or because the charts cannot be 
   fitted on the page, an error message is shown and the Data page is displayed. After editing the data, 
   select the Chart page to see the charts. Some common errors and solutions are discussed in the 
   <A HREF="#Problems">Problems</A> section.</P>
<P>Once the charts are drawn, the Chart page opens showing the full page as it would appear on paper, 
   including the margins. Menu commands, buttons and key commands are then available for navigating 
   through the pages, moving around on the current page and zooming in or out 
   (see <A HREF="#ChartMenu">Chart menu</A>).</P>
<P>The data can be saved and printed by selecting File – Save or File – Print data from the Main menu. 
   Chart pages can printed (Chart – Print), or copied or <A HREF="#Export">exported</A> as 
   Enhanced Metafiles (Chart – Copy or Chart – Export). See the <A HREF="#Problems">Problems</A> section 
   for solutions to some common problems with importing charts into 
   word processing and presentation software.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="FilesDirs"></A><A NAME="_Toc21"></A><B>Files and directories</B></P>
<P>MapChart datafiles have the extension *.mct. In addition, MapChart can read 
   the *.map / *.set file pairs produced by MapChart version 1.x; on reading 
   these files the color codes (that followed a different scheme in version 1.x) 
   will be updated automatically. If a *.map file without corresponding *.set file 
   is opened (such as map files exported by Joinmap) 
   the <A HREF="#DefaultChartOptions">Default Chart Options</A> will be used. 
   If a chart contains graphs, for each graph line
   the specified <A HREF="#GraphFiles">graph file</A> must exist. </P>
<P><A NAME="DefaultDir"></A>The Open file and Save file dialogs start 
   in the last used working directory.
   If this directory is not accessible a default working directory will be used.
   This default directory can be specified with the command-line option /D=&lt;dir&gt;.
   If no default directory is specified, c:\ will be used.</P>
<P><A NAME="ChartFiles"></A><A NAME="EMFfiles"></A><A NAME="Export"></A>MapChart can export
   <B>chart files</B>, each containing a page with one or more linkage group charts,
   in the same directory as the *.mct file. These chart files have the name of the *.mct file
   followed by a three-digit page number, and extension ".emf", indicating that they are in
   "Enhanced Metafile" format, or &quot;.bmp&quot; for Bitmap format.
   For example, exporting metafiles from a project named apple.mct will produce apple001.emf,
   apple002.emf and so on. These files can be imported into other applications such as
   word processors and presentation software.
   <B>Please note that exported Bitmaps will generally be very large;</B> in the order
   of 50-60 MB for an A4 page at a resolution of 600 dpi.
   Almost always Metafiles will be preferable to Bitmaps. </P>
<P>Also individual pages can be copied to the Clipboard (select Chart menu – Copy page
   or the Copy Page button) and pasted into other applications that can handle enhanced
   metafiles. It may be necessary to use &quot;Paste special&quot; or &quot;Paste as metafile&quot;
   instead of &quot;Paste&quot; in the receiving application.
   See the <A HREF="#Problems">Problems</A> section for solutions to some common problems
   with importing charts into word processing and presentation software.</P>

<P><A NAME="LinkGrpsChrom"></A><A NAME="_Toc22"></A><B>Linkage groups versus Chromosomes</B></P>
<P>In general, MapChart draws all linkage groups side-by-side as independent units. Linkage group declarations can start with the keywords &quot;Group&quot; or &quot;Chrom&quot;; they have exactly the same effect, and the &quot;Chrom&quot; keyword is only included for compatibility with older JoinMap versions.</P>
<P>However, sometimes it is known that two or more linkage groups represent different parts of the same chromosome. In this case it is customary to draw these linkage groups aligned vertically, one above the other. MapChart offers a possibility to do that, using the <A HREF="#AlignVertically">Align vertically</A> parameter in the linkage group header. This parameter creates an aligned group of linkage groups, which are treated as a unit. This affects not only the drawing of the maps, but also the drawing of <A HREF="#Homologs">Homologs</A>: Homologs between linkage groups within the same  &quot;aligned group&quot; are drawn like homologs within the same linkage group. Also the Combine Maps tool treats these aligned groups as units.</P>
<P>If the <A HREF="#SplitMap">Split Map</A> chart option is active, the maps of long linkage groups are divided into parts that are drawn side-by-side. In that case, vertical alignment becomes pointless and the Align vertically parameter is ignored.</P>

<P><A HREF="#Contents">Contents</A> <A HREF="#Index">Index</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="MarkerDistribAnalysis"></A><A NAME="_Toc23"></A><B>Marker distribution analysis</B></P>
<P>MapChart can help to study the distribution of different marker categories over the map.
   This can be useful for selecting <I>e.g.</I> AFLP primer combinations that together
   provide a good map coverage. There are two possibilities to do so:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Manually: Give markers of different categories (<I>e.g.</I> different primer combinations)
    different color codes (which is perhaps most easily done using a spreadsheet),
	create sufficient colors and set all the color values initially to black
	(<A HREF="#OptionsColors">Chart options - Colors&amp;Lines</A> page).
	By setting selected color codes to a contrasting color the distribution
	of the corresponding marker categories is clearly shown. This method is shown
	in <A HREF="#Examples">Example 5</A>.</LI>
<LI>Automatically: If the marker categories can be recognized in part of the
    marker names, it is possible to give each marker category a different color
	using the Homologs function. On the first
	<A HREF="#Homologs">Chart options - Homologs</A> page, check Show Homologs
	and set the "Compare loci" options to compare the relevant part of the marker
	names. Check Hilight loci - Font color and select "One color per homologs set".
	Also, disable the drawing of lines between homologs on different and on the
	same linkage groups (second Homologs page).<BR>
    If the number of marker categories is larger than the number of defined
	color codes, the extra color codes are created but initially all given the
	same color. Use the
	<A HREF="#OptionsColors">Chart options - Colors&amp;Lines</A> page to give
	them each a different color value.</LI>
</UL>


<P><A HREF="#Contents">Contents</A> <A HREF="#Index">Index</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="DataFormat"></A><A NAME="_Toc24"></A><B>Data format</B></P>
<P>MapChart reads linkage and QTL data from text files.
   These files must contain &quot;flat text&quot;, such as produced by a
   text editor. MapChart cannot read text files in word processor formats.
   The text is displayed in an editor, which can be used to enter, inspect
   and modify the data.</P>
<P>The text containing the map data specifies a sequence of linkage groups.
   Each linkage group specification consists of a header line, followed by
   a loci section and optionally a QTLs, Graphs and/or a Segments section.
   Blank lines and lines containing only comments (i.e. lines where the
   first non-blank character is &quot;;&quot;) may occur anywhere in the file
   and are ignored. Comments may also appear behind other information on a line:
   in that case the &quot;;&quot; must be preceded by blanks.</P>
<P>It is possible to let MapChart ignore loci or whole linkage groups
   temporarily by &quot;commenting out&quot; the relevant lines.
   In order to do so, place the &quot;;&quot; character at the start of all
   relevant lines; by removing this character the information is made available
   again.<BR/>
   <A NAME="CommentLines"></A><A NAME="UncommentLines"></A>The editor provides two
   functions to quickly &quot;comment&quot; and &quot;uncomment&quot;
   a whole selection of lines (choose Edit – Comment lines or
   Edit – Uncomment lines from the main menu).</P>
<P>Many parameters for controlling different aspects of the chart elements
   are discussed below. An overview of these codes is available in the file
   &quot;MapChart formatting codes.rtf&quot; in the MapChart program directory.
   This file can be read and printed by any word processor.</P>

<P><A HREF="#Contents">Contents</A> <A HREF="#Index">Index</A></P>

<P><A NAME="LinkageGroupHeader"></A><A NAME="_Toc25"></A><B><I>Linkage group header</I></B></P>
<P>The specification of a linkage group starts with the linkage group header. The header line of a linkage group starts with the keyword &quot;group&quot; or &quot;chrom&quot; followed by the linkage group name. The name will be shown with upper and lower case characters as entered. If the name contains blanks it must be enclosed by double quotes. If no name is desired, enter &quot;&quot; (two consecutive double quotes) if any of the other options are used.</P>
<P>After the name the following optional parameters may be supplied, in any order but all on the same line: </P>

<UL>
<LI>S=&lt;number&gt; (Start position, &lt;number&gt; in cM):
    set the Start position of the linkage group bar to a point
	(in centimorgan) before the first locus or QTL</LI>
<LI>E=&lt;number&gt; (End position, &lt;number&gt; in cM):
    set the End position of the linkage group bar to a point (in cM)
	beyond the last locus or QTL</LI>
<LI><A NAME="VertShift"></A>V=&lt;number&gt; (Vertical shift,
    &lt;number&gt; in mm or map units): Normally the tops of all linkage
	group bars are aligned, using the method chosen in the
	Chart options – Bars dialog. This parameter allows to shift the bars
	of individual linkage groups up or down by the number of mm specified.
	Useful for aligning corresponding loci on different linkage groups.
	If you wish to specify the vertical shift in map units instead of mm,
	set the "Vertical shift units" option to "map units (cM)" in
	<A HREF="#OptionsBars">Chart options - Bars</A></LI>
<LI><A NAME="HorizShift"></A>H=&lt;number&gt; (Horizontal shift,
    &lt;number&gt; in mm): The default space left of a linkage group chart
	is set in <A HREF="#OptionsPageLayout">Chart options - Page layout</A>;
	for individual linkage groups this space can be made smaller or wider
	by setting this parameter (in mm). Useful for visually grouping linkage
	groups, or to have a larger space between linkage groups than between
	segments of the same linkage group.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="PageBreak"></A>P: Force a page break before this linkage group.
    Useful for visually grouping linkage groups.</LI>
<LI>R: Reverse the linkage group vertically, by measuring all locus,
    QTL and Graph point positions from the linkage group end instead
	of from the start.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="Mirror"></A>M: Mirror the location (right vs. left of
    linkage group bar) of locus names and QTL bars with respect to the
	current chart options. Useful for pairwise comparison of maps,
	<I>e.g.</I> of the paternal and maternal map of a linkage group.
	Note: Graphs will always appear on the right side.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="AlignVertically"></A>A: Align vertically with the
    previous linkage group. All consecutive linkage groups with this option
	and the last preceding linkage group are grouped into an "Aligned group"
	representing parts of the same chromosome
	(<A HREF="#Examples">Example2 - formatting</A>; see also
	<A HREF="#LinkGrpsChrom">Linkage groups versus Chromosomes</A>).
	The effect is that the chromosome bar,

<P><A NAME="GraphFiles"></A><A NAME="_Toc30"></A><B>Graph files</B></P>
<P>Graph files contain the coordinates of all the points specifying graph
   lines. From version 2.2 the format of graph files has been extended to
   allow data for multiple linkage groups to be specified in the same file,
   which should reduce the clutter of files.</P>
<P>A Graph file starts with a line of column titles; subsequent lines contain
   the values for a series of points (in order of increasing map position,
   and grouped per linkage group). MapChart uses the value in column
   &quot;cM&quot;, &quot;map&quot; or &quot;position&quot; as the
   map position of the point, and by default the value in the column
   &quot;lod&quot; as the function value. If present, the column
   &quot;group&quot; lists the linkage groups; this is needed in files
   containing data for multiple linkage groups.
   If a value (or any text) is present in the last column, a symbol is
   shown at that point in the graph. Instead of the &quot;lod&quot; column,
   any other column title may be specified for the function value, using
   the <A HREF="#ColumnTitles">T=&lt;column title&gt;</A> formatting option
   of the graph. In this way, one graph file can define multiple graphs,
   each specified using a different column title. Using the
   comment character (&quot;;&quot;), comments may be added at the end
   of a line or between lines.</P>
<P>The keywords &quot;cM&quot;, &quot;map&quot;, &quot;position&quot;
   and &quot;group&quot;, and the column name for reading the Y-values
   are not case-sensitive. In contrast, the name of the linkage group
   listed in the &quot;group&quot; column must be exactly identical to
   the name of the linkage group in the MapChart file. If the group names
   in the Graph file are different from those in the MapChart file, the
   <A HREF="#GraphGroupname">G=&lt;groupname&gt;</A> option can be used
   to specify which group name to read from the graph file.</P>
<P>Graphs may contain points with map positions beyond the linkage group
   start or end, but only the part between the linkage group start and end
   will be shown. Points with function values outside the specified Low
   or High ends of the <A HREF="#YaxisFormatting">Y-axis</A> will cause
   the Y-axis range to be extended. Further, if the file does not contain
   a &quot;group&quot; column, or if only one group name occurs in this
   column (even if different from the linkage group where this graph
   belongs), all the lines of the file are read.</P>
<P>For compatibility with earlier MapChart versions, the line of column
   titles may be omitted. In that case the first column should contain
   the map positions, the second column the function values, and if a
   third number or text is present on a line a symbol will be shown at
   that point. Such files define a graph for a single linkage group.</P>
<P><A NAME="MapQTLgraphFiles"></A>MapChart can read the output of
   MapQTL 3.0 and 4.0, as exported using the &quot;Copy text&quot; command,
   and the output of MapQTL 5.0 and 6.0 as exported using the
   &quot;Export to File&quot; command. By default, MapChart will use the
   &quot;LOD&quot; column for function values in the case of Interval
   mapping or MQM mapping, and the &quot;K*&quot; column in the case of
   Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Don’t edit the MapQTL files, e.g. by adding

   It is possible to define a large number of extra color codes,
   which initially all get the same color value (see 
   <A HREF="#AddColorRange">Add range</A>). This may be useful
   when dealing with many categories of loci (e.g. AFLP markers based
   on many different primer combinations): assign each category its own
   color code, but assign the same color value to all these codes.

<UL>
<LI>Height of chart area: the result of Chart options - Page size (paper size, paper orientation, page margins) and Chart options - Page layout (chart title font, title bottom margin, linkage group names font and bottom margin). The height of the chart area is displayed as an aid in deciding the position and size of the linkage group bars.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="AlignHoriz"></A>Alignment: By default, the tops of the
    linkage group bars are aligned at the same height.
	If the linkage groups start with different map positions it is
	possible to align the groups with corresponding map positions at
	the same height.</LI>
<LI>Tops position: either the longest bar is centered vertically in the
    chart area, or the position of the top of the linkage group bars
	(relative to the top of the chart area) can be specified.
	The second option is most useful for drawing maps from different
	datafiles with the same layout. The tops of all linkage group bars
	are aligned by default; individual linkage groups can be shifted
	up or down (see <A HREF="#LinkageGroupHeader">linkage group header</A>).</LI>
<LI>Vertical shift units: the <A HREF="#VertShift">Vertical shift</A>
    specified in the linkage group header can be expressed in mm or
	in map units.</LI>
<LI>Bar length: either the length of the longest bar or the scale
   (in mm per cM) can be specified. The second option is useful for
   drawing maps from different datafiles to the same scale.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="IndicatorsHighlight"></A>Highlight indicators:
    if a locus name is highlighted in any way (by specifying different
	font attributes, font size or color), the indicator connecting it
	to the linkage group bar can be shown bold and/or in the color of
	the locus name. This works also if the locus is highlighted because
	it is a <A HREF="#Homologs">homolog</A> of another locus.
	If these options are checked, the indicator of a cluster of loci
	is highlighted if any locus in that cluster is highlighted, and it
	gets the color of the <I>last</I> highlighted locus in the cluster.
	(The Bold attribute of the indicators may not be visible in the
	full-page view; it is always visible at the highest zoom level and
	on the printed page).</LI>
<LI>Indicator size: the horizontal size of the lines connecting the
    positions and the locus names to the linkage group bar.</LI>
<LI>Bar width (in mm): the width of the linkage group bar.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="SplitMap"></A>Split map interval: if set to 0 linkage groups
    won’t be split up; otherwise linkage groups longer than the interval
	specified here will be divided into segments and drawn as if they were
	separate linkage groups, with a number added to the original linkage
	group name. QTL bars and Graphs will also be split up
	(<A HREF="#Examples">Example4 - QTLs and split map</A>).</LI>
<LI>Round tips: when checked, the linkage group bars have round tips,
    otherwise flat tips. Note: if the linkage group is split into segments
	(see previous option), only the start and end of the whole linkage group
	will show a round tip when this option is checked.</LI>

<LI>Locus name position: the locus names can be shown on the left or the right side of the linkage group bar; the position information will appear on the opposite side. </LI>
<LI>Locus names per line: in case more than one locus occurs at the same (rounded) position, all the loci of the cluster are printed in one group. Here the number of loci per line in a cluster is specified. The more loci per line, the easier it will be to fit the chart within the available chart height, but the wider the chart will become. If 0 is entered, no locus names are shown.</LI>
<LI>Show locus texts: Optionally a text can be specified for each locus
    (see <A HREF="#LociSection">Data format - Loci</A> section).
	These text will only be shown if this checkbox is checked,
	and only if one locus name per line is shown (see previous option).<BR/>

	By checking this option, the formatting of each locus name is also
	applied to its locus texts.</LI>
<LI>Positions: There are five options: positions of loci can be omitted, the absolute positions, interval lengths or ticks at fixed intervals can be shown along the linkage group bar, or a ruler can be shown at the left side of the page.</LI>

<P><A NAME="Homologs"></A><A NAME="_Toc39"></A><B><I>Homologs pages</I></B></P>
<P>MapChart can highlight homologies between loci. Loci can be grouped into
   homologs groups based on similarity of their names, and/or based on their
   <A HREF="#HomologNumber">homolog number</A> which can be specified on the
   Data sheet. Each locus can be part of only one homologs group.
   Loci in the same group are shown in the same color and connected by lines,
   if these options are selected.</P>
<P>If the &quot;Match locus names&quot; checkbox (see below) is NOT checked,
   loci with the same homolog number are grouped together.
   If the &quot;Match locus names&quot; checkbox is checked,
   the loci are grouped in the first place based on name similarity.
   Further, loci that you wish to remove from such a group you can give a
   NEGATIVE homolog number (if you give several loci the same negative
   homolog number, they will form a new group).
   If you want to add extra loci to a group, give the same POSITIVE
   homolog number to those loci and to one or more of the loci already
   in the group.</P>
<P>The <A HREF="#CombineMaps">Combine Maps</A> tool makes it easy to
   place corresponding linkage groups from different files side by side,
   so that homologies can be clearly shown.</P>
<P>The options on these pages specify how to show homologs:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Show homologs: if unchecked, no homologies are shown and the rest
    of these pages are not relevant.</LI>
<LI>Compare loci: If the "Match locus names" checkbox is checked,
    loci are recognized as homologous if the specified part of their names
	is identical, possibly ignoring upper/lowercase differences.
	The default setting "Ignore last 0 characters" only recognizes
	completely identical names as homologs. See the beginning of this
	paragraph about how <A HREF="#HomologNumber">homolog numbers</A>
	influence this grouping.</LI>
<LI>Highlight loci: The names of homologous loci can be highlighted.
    If the Font style, Font size and/or Font color checkboxes are checked,
	the specified formatting is used for homologous loci, overruling the
	corresponding formatting specified on the Data page. If these three
	checkboxes are left unchecked (default), locus names are not highlighted.
	If Font color is checked, you can further choose to show all homologs
	in the same color or to use a different color for each homologs group.
	In the last case, color codes 2 and up are used for the homologs groups.
	If there are more groups than color codes, the extra necessary color
	codes are generated but they will initially all receive a gray color value.
	You will receive a warning that you need to specify the desired color
	values for these extra color codes afterwards (see the Chart options -
	<A HREF="#OptionsColors">Colors&amp;Lines</A> page).</LI>
<LI>Connections between linkage groups: Connections are the lines connecting two homologs. They can be shown only between adjacent linkage groups or between all linkage groups on the same page.</LI>
<LI>Connections within linkage groups: Connections can also be shown between homologous loci on the same linkage group. These connections have the form of a half ellipse and can be shown on the left or right side of the linkage group bar. "Width of curve" specifies how wide the half ellipses are at their midpoints.</LI>
<LI>Connection style: A connection between homologous loci consists of
    a line with a "dot" at each end, at the positions of the loci
	(or clusters of loci) on the linkage groups. <BR>
    The size and color of the dots, and the line style can be specified.
	A dot size of 0 mm hides the dot; line style "no line" hides the line.
	The lines can be drawn in normal width or bold. Further, the lines can
	either all have the same color: the color of the dots,
	or a different color per homologs group, or a different color per pair
	of linkage groups. In the second case, if a line connects clusters with
	several homologs groups, the line will be drawn as several parallel lines
	in the different colors (it may be necessary to choose Bold
	lines to see this clearly). <BR>
    As described above under Highlight loci, in the last two cases color
	codes 2 and up are used. If there aren’t enough color codes,
	the extra necessary color codes are generated but they will initially
	all receive a gray color value. You will need to specify the desired
	color values for these extra color codes afterwards (see the Chart options
	- <A HREF="#OptionsColors">Colors&amp;Lines</A> page).<BR>
	If the two homologous loci are on different pages,
	the dots are drawn but the line is omitted.</LI>

   up the map into segments.</P>
<P><I>Example5 - marker highlighting and footer:</I></P>
<P>In this map, every category of markers has its own color code.
   By setting all color codes to black and one to red, it is easy to

   Also shows effect of formatting code o ("omitted") for loci.</P>
<P>Also the effect of showing page numbers in the chart title is demonstrated.</P>
<P><I>Example6 - auto-QTLs:</I></P>
<P>Map with two linkage groups, each with one QTL.
   The QTLs are shown in three ways: (a) the significance of the
   Kruskal-Wallis test at each locus is indicated by asterisks in a
   separate text column, (b) the LOD graphs along the linkage groups
   are shown, together with a constant line indicating the LOD threshold,
   and (c) 1- and 2-LOD intervals are shown, calculated automatically
   from the LOD graphs.</P>
   <P><I>Example7 - multi-QTL and graphs:</I></P>
<P>Here, 3 LOD graphs and 3 auto-QTL intervals are shown on the same
   chromosome.</P>

<P><A NAME="Problems"></A><A NAME="_Toc49"></A><B>Problems and solutions</B></P>

<P><I>No map data available:</I> This error message will appear if
   MapChart cannot find the start of the data. The data should start
   with the heading for the first linkage group (starting with the word
   &quot;group&quot; or &quot;chrom&quot;). If you have other text appearing
   above the first linkage group, delete it or comment it out (place a
   semicolon at the start of each comment line).</P>
<P><I>Error in position of locus</I>: MapChart expects a valid number
   after the marker name, indicating the position; the loci must be
   listed in order of ascending position. </P>
<P><I>Error in point … in graph…:</I> Each line in a graph file should
   give at least two valid numbers (see <A HREF="#GraphFiles">Graph files</A>).
   The points must be in ascending order of X (map position) values.</P>
<P><I>Error messages stating that the charts don’t fit in the available
   space</I>: Probably the height of the charts is larger than the space
   between the page margins. This can be solved by increasing the available
   page height, and by decreasing the chart height.
   The page height can be increased by choosing a portrait instead of
   landscape paper orientation and by setting smaller margins
   (both through the File – Chart page setup menu option).
   The chart height can be decreased by changing several chart options
   (Tools - Chart options menu option or toolbar button).
   Most effective will be choosing a smaller Locus font size,
   increasing the number of locus names per line
   (both on the Chart options – Loci page), and splitting linkage groups
   into segments (&quot;Split map interval&quot; in the
   Chart options – Bars page). Also choosing a smaller Title, Name or
   Y-axis font may help.<BR/>
   Finally shifting linkage group bars up or down may cause them to move
   outside the chart area; in that case their length must be decreased,
   or the shifting must be adjusted. The <A HREF="#Autofit">Autofit</A>
   utility can check out many of these combinations.</P>

<P><A HREF="#Contents">Contents</A> <A HREF="#Index">Index</A></P>

<P><I>Changes in graph files don’t appear in the charts:</I>
   When MapChart needs to display a chart, it first checks if there
   are changes on the Data page or in the chart options. If not,
   no new charts are calculated and the previously calculated
   charts are shown again. Since changing a graph file does not change
   the Data page, the charts will not be recalculated.
   In this case select <A HREF="#Recalculate">Recalculate</A> from
   the Tools menu or button bar: this causes the data and graph files
   to be read again and new charts to be calculated. Also make sure
   that you have saved the edited graph file before recalculating the charts!</P>
<P><I>Charts imported into other applications are printed with very
   thick lines</I>: When MapChart draws the charts, the width of lines
   is as specified on the
   <A HREF="#OptionsLineWidth">Chart options - Colors&amp;Lines</A> tab,
   but at least one pixel of the output device. If no Windows printer is
   installed, the screen resolution will be used, which is very coarse,
   so even one pixel may appear quite thick. Try generating the charts
   on a computer with a printer, and the charts will be drawn using the
   printer resolution. The same problem occurs when the computer is running
   in "Safe Mode": in that case no printer drivers are installed.</P>
<P><I>Some chart elements appear distorted after importing into MS-Word or
   MS-PowerPoint:</I> To avoid changes on importing, make sure that the
   imported image does not have to be resized. Images exported from MapChart
   (either by saving as *.emf file, or by copying to the clipboard) contain
   the area <I>within</I> the margins; by a suitable combination of page
   and margin sizes (Chart options - Page setup) the desired size can be
   obtained. Also, exporting the *.emf file from MapChart and importing
   (Insert Picture from file) seems to give better results than copying
   via the Clipboard.</P>

<P><I>Texts and names in charts imported into other applications are
   not drawn at the correct size</I>: When charts are only imported
   into word processing or presentation software there is no problem.
   However, when the charts are edited (especially if they are
   &quot;split into objects&quot; or &quot;ungrouped&quot;) they may
   be converted to the internal format of the importing application.
   At that moment, fonts may change a little in size, causing texts
   to become somewhat wider and to overlap if they are positioned close
   together. For example, this happens in Microsoft PowerPoint when the
   &quot;Ungroup&quot; command is used. This is usually almost invisible
   when charts are drawn at the printer resolution, but can be problematic
   when drawn at screen resolution (on a computer with no printer installed).
   It also depends on the font and font size used.
   If the problem arises, try generating the charts on a computer
   with an installed printer, and/or try changing fonts or font sizes.</P>
<P><I>Charts copied to MS PowerPoint are shown very small:</I>
   If charts are copied to MS PowerPoint through the Clipboard
   (using the Copy Page button or Ctrl-C), they must be pasted using
   Edit – Paste Special – Enhanced Metafile in MS PowerPoint.
   Using the Paste button or Ctrl-V results in a very small picture.
   Another way to import charts into MS PowerPoint is
   Insert – Picture – From file, after using Chart export in MapChart.</P>

<P><I>Graph lines in charts imported into other applications cannot
   be edited:</I> The dashed and dotted lines in graphs are composed of
   short line segments. After importing a chart into another application
   and &quot;splitting to objects&quot; or &quot;ungrouping&quot;,
   the graph lines are not one object any more, and cannot be edited
   as a whole. The solution is to draw with solid lines (line style L1,
   the default value) in MapChart; solid lines remain one object after
   imported charts are split. In the importing application the line style
   can then be changed as desired.</P>
<P><I>White lines and texts are invisible:</I> If you need white graphics
   on a transparent background, <I>e.g.</I> to place them on a dark
   background in another application, choose a dark color for the
   background (color code C0) in the
   <A HREF="#OptionsColors">Chart options - Colors&amp;Lines</A>
   page dialog, and check &quot;Background transparent&quot;.
   In MapChart you will see the charts against a dark background,
   but the copied or exported metafiles will have a transparent background.</P>
